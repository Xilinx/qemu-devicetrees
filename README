This repo is used to build QEMU specific device trees for the Zynq Ultrascale+
architecture. These device trees are used by the QEMU provided by Xilinx to
internally generate machine models.

For more instructions on running QEMU see the Xilinx wiki:
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/821395464/QEMU+User+Documentation

To build the device trees:
   1. You must have dtc on your PATH, or specify DTC= env to a dtc executable.
   2. Run make

This will give you a folder called LATEST which contains subdirectories for the
different QEMU operating modes. Under these sub directories is the board
specific device trees.

Xilinx welcomes and encourages users to send patches to this repository. If you
